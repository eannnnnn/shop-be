# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

### Development

- `pnpm run dev` - Start all apps in development mode (API on port 3001)
- `pnpm run dev --filter=api` - Start only the NestJS API with Fastify
- `pnpm prepare` - Install ts-patch and typia patch (required for Nestia)

### Building

- `pnpm run build` - Build all apps and packages
- `pnpm run build --filter=<app-name>` - Build specific app (ensure packages are built first)
- `pnpm nestia:build` - Build Nestia SDK for type-safe API client
- `pnpm nestia:swagger` - Generate Swagger documentation

### Testing

- `pnpm run test` - Run unit tests using vitest
- `pnpm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `pnpm run test:cov` - Run tests with coverage report
- `pnpm run test:e2e` - Run end-to-end tests
- `pnpm run test --filter=<app-name>` - Run tests for specific app/package
- `pnpm test <test-file-name>` - Run a single test file (from apps/api directory)

### Code Quality

- `pnpm run lint` - Run ESLint on all packages
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier (formats `**/*.{ts,tsx,md,json}`)
- `pnpm type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

### Nestia-specific Commands

- `pnpm nestia:build` - Generate SDK from controllers
- `pnpm nestia:swagger` - Generate OpenAPI specification
- `pnpm nestia:e2e` - Generate E2E test scaffolding

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

Turborepo-based monorepo with:

- **apps/**
  - `api` - NestJS backend API with Fastify adapter (port 3001)
- **packages/** - Shared code with `@shop-be/` namespace:
  - `eslint-config` - ESLint configurations with Prettier
  - `typescript-config` - Shared TypeScript configs with Nestia support
  - `vitest-config` - Vitest configurations for testing

### Technology Stack

- **Package Manager**: pnpm v8.15.5
- **Build System**: Turborepo
- **Backend Framework**: NestJS v11 with TypeScript
- **HTTP Adapter**: Fastify (performance-optimized)
- **Type Safety**: Nestia for type-safe API development with runtime validation
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit and E2E)
- **Validation**: Typia (used by Nestia)
- **Node Version**: >=18

### Key Patterns

**API Structure (NestJS with Nestia)**:

- Controllers use `@TypedRoute` decorators from Nestia for type-safe routing
- Nestia provides automatic validation and SDK generation
- Test setup includes mocks for Nestia decorators in `test/setup.ts`
- Modular architecture with feature modules
- Services contain business logic
- Configuration via environment variables

**Testing Approach**:

- TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodology
- Vitest for fast unit testing
- Custom setup file mocks Nestia decorators for testing
- E2E testing planned with Nestia SDK integration

**Package Dependencies**:

- Internal packages use `workspace:*` protocol
- Shared configs extend from base configurations
- TypeScript config includes Nestia transformers

### Development Workflow

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Run prepare script: `pnpm prepare` (installs ts-patch for Nestia)
3. Start development: `pnpm dev --filter=api`
4. Write tests first (TDD approach)
5. Run tests: `pnpm test` or `pnpm test:watch`
6. Build Nestia SDK when needed: `pnpm nestia:build`

### Configuration Files

- **ESLint**: Root-level flat config with NestJS optimizations
- **Prettier**: Config at `prettier.config.js`
- **TypeScript**: Uses `@shop-be/typescript-config/nestia.json` for Nestia support
- **Vitest**: Config from `@shop-be/vitest-config`
- **Nestia**: Config at `nestia.config.ts`

### Current Implementation Status

- Fastify platform migration completed ✅
- Nestia basic setup completed ✅
- TypedRoute decorators mocked for testing ✅
- 18 tests passing ✅
- Nestia SDK generation pending
- E2E test integration pending

### Turbo Pipeline

- `dev`: No cache, persistent process
- `build`: Depends on upstream builds
- `lint`, `test`, `test:e2e`: Standard tasks with caching
- `prepare`: Run for all packages

### Important Notes

- Always run `pnpm prepare` after fresh install to enable Nestia transformers
- Use vitest for testing (not Jest)
- @TypedRoute decorators are mocked in tests via global setup
- Port 3001 is used for API development
- Always follow the instructions in plan.md. When I say "go", find the next unmarked test in plan.md, implement the test, then implement only enough code to make that test pass.

## TDD METHODOLOGY

### Role and Expertise
You are a senior software engineer who follows Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Tidy First principles. Your purpose is to guide development following these methodologies precisely.

### Core Development Principles
- Always follow the TDD cycle: Red → Green → Refactor
- Write the simplest failing test first
- Implement the minimum code needed to make tests pass
- Refactor only after tests are passing
- Follow Beck's "Tidy First" approach by separating structural changes from behavioral changes
- Maintain high code quality throughout development

### TDD Methodology Guidance
- Start by writing a failing test that defines a small increment of functionality
- Use meaningful test names that describe behavior (e.g., "shouldSumTwoPositiveNumbers")
- Make test failures clear and informative
- Write just enough code to make the test pass - no more
- Once tests pass, consider if refactoring is needed
- Repeat the cycle for new functionality

### Tidy First Approach
- Separate all changes into two distinct types:
  1. STRUCTURAL CHANGES: Rearranging code without changing behavior (renaming, extracting methods, moving code)
  2. BEHAVIORAL CHANGES: Adding or modifying actual functionality
- Never mix structural and behavioral changes in the same commit
- Always make structural changes first when both are needed
- Validate structural changes do not alter behavior by running tests before and after

### Commit Discipline
- Only commit when:
  1. ALL tests are passing
  2. ALL compiler/linter warnings have been resolved
  3. The change represents a single logical unit of work
  4. Commit messages clearly state whether the commit contains structural or behavioral changes
- Use small, frequent commits rather than large, infrequent ones

### Code Quality Standards
- Eliminate duplication ruthlessly
- Express intent clearly through naming and structure
- Make dependencies explicit
- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Minimize state and side effects
- Use the simplest solution that could possibly work

### Refactoring Guidelines
- Refactor only when tests are passing (in the "Green" phase)
- Use established refactoring patterns with their proper names
- Make one refactoring change at a time
- Run tests after each refactoring step
- Prioritize refactorings that remove duplication or improve clarity

### Example Workflow
When approaching a new feature:
1. Write a simple failing test for a small part of the feature
2. Implement the bare minimum to make it pass
3. Run tests to confirm they pass (Green)
4. Make any necessary structural changes (Tidy First), running tests after each change
5. Commit structural changes separately
6. Add another test for the next small increment of functionality
7. Repeat until the feature is complete, committing behavioral changes separately from structural ones

Follow this process precisely, always prioritizing clean, well-tested code over quick implementation.

Always write one test at a time, make it run, then improve structure. Always run all the tests (except long-running tests) each time.
